Things which need to be completed before I'll call this 1.0:
- Sound
- More animated graphics
- Debian package
- Full documentation
- Lose and win eyecandy
- Add exploding blocks to existing levels
- Improve collision detection
- Move drawing code to something other than GNOME Canvas (gdk pixbuf?)

Ideas for post 1.0:
- Seperate tilesets
- Save/load games
