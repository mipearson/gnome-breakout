feature, n:
        A surprising property of a program.  Occasionaly documented.  To
        call a property a feature sometimes means the author did not
        consider that case, and the program makes an unexpected, though
        not necessarily wrong response.  See BUG.  "That's not a bug, it's
        a feature!"  A bug can be changed to a feature by documenting it.

- The ball gets enters infinite bouncing loops if it gets stuck between a
series of invincible blocks. Again, a design bug, which I've currently worked
around by randomizing the direction of the ball after 20 seconds of airtime
and by adding the "Kill Ball" menu item.

- Entropy will amplify collision detection bugs. I think it's horrible,
regardless, but somebody wanted it implimented.

- Entropy sucks. It's supposed to.

- When keyboard control is enabled, and the app has keyboard focus, and the
pointer is outside the window, the application doesn't register keyup events.
This gets annoying very quickly, but I can't seem to work out how to fix it.

- There may be issues with the automatic pause logic.

- Probably uses deprecated GNOME/GTK functions. Most of the development on
GNOME Breakout was done in the first quarter of 2000, and the API has probably
changed since then.
